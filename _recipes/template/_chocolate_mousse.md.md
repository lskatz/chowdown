  - 300g dark chocolate (at least 70%)
  - 3 tbsp caster sugar

  - Add the sugar to the yolks and whisk
  - Put the chocolate broken into pieces and the butter in a heat resistant container and heat in a ‘bain marie’ until it is smooth (not a single drop of  water should enter the container, or everything is ruined !)

This recipe is from our friends the Poggios. We first ate it at their house and when they came to dinner we insisted they brought chocolate mousse with them.

It is extremely chocolately.
